*OCSP Server is a **OCSP responder**, the Rust implementation of the [python version](https://github.com/DorianCoding/OCSP_MySql).*

----

This software implements a OCSP responder in Rust, fetching certificate status in a Mysql/MariaDB database. Unlike the Python implementation, it **does implement its own TCP listener** on a user-selected port.
*It will answer to any **GET or POST** requests on any URL*.
## Requirements
- A CA certificate (self-signed allowed) and/or an intermediate CA that will sign leaf certificates.
- A config file (config.toml) in the same directory. As well, files indicated in this file must also be accessible.
- A Mysql database containing all certificates (check below) that could be checked and were signed.

## What is done
- Extract OCSP requests, verify it is a signed certificate by the CA, check in the database if it is good or revoked and sign the response. It also caches answers for some days to avoid RSA calculations.
- Create a specific user for this task to ensure protection for intermediate certificate, as the private key is required.
## What is not done
- Only leaf certificates will be signed as valid, not the intermediate one.
- No control is performed on the TCP socket and it should not be open to public as it but rather behind a reverse proxy that controls the flow, such as Apache or Nginx. Requests are limited to 3 Mb.

> [!TIP]
> The intermediate certificate should be signed by CA in an OCSP response that is stored separately. The CA certificate and private key should be stored offline.

## Config file
The config file should contain the following informations :
```toml
#Config file, all fields are compulsory
cachedays = 3 #Number of days a response is valid once created (only for valid certificates)
dbip = "127.0.0.1" #Optional. IP to connect to MySql database. If absent, use of unix socket.
db_type = "mysql" # Can be "mysql" or "postgres" or "sqlite"
dbuser = "cert" #Username to connect to MySql database
dbport = 3306 # Optional: Default 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL
dbname = "certs" #Name to connect to MySql data
dbpassword = "certdata" #Password to connect to cert data
port = 9000 #Port to listen to, from 1 to 65535. Cannot use a port already used by another service (privileged ports allowed if used as root or as a service). By default 9000
listen_ip = "0.0.0.0" # Optional: IP address to listen on (default: 127.0.0.1)
timeout = 5 #Optional timeout, default 5s
cachefolder = "cache/" #Folder to cache data (relative or absolute, will be created if not present)
itcert = "/var/public_files/it_cert.crt" #Path to intermediate certificate as PEM format
itkey = "/var/private_files/it_privkey.pem" #Path to intermediate private key, keep it secret (PKCS#8 format, only RSA keys supported so far)
revocextended = true #Optional, if you want to enable EXTENDED_REVOCATION
caching = true #Optional, enable caching or enable nonce response.
create_table = true # Optional: Creates the table if it doesn't exist
table_name = "custom_certs" # Optional: Custom table name (default is list_certs for MySQL, ocsp_list_certs for PostgreSQL)
enable_api = true # Optional: Enable the certificate management API
api_keys = ["secure-api-key-1", "secure-api-key-2"] # Optional: List of valid API keys for authentication
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Config.toml should be read-only for the script and inaccessible for others because it contains dbpassword.
> Test files are TEST FILES and SHOULD NOT BE USED in any way for production.
> Intermediate/Signer certificate key should be held secret, must be read-only for the script and inaccessible to anyone else. The intermediate/Signer certificate should be world-readonly, including to the script.
> As a service, the script will use a brand-new user called pycert. This ensures system integrity and protection. All the filesystem is locked by systemd except the cache folder.
> The responder will reply to any certificate that are present in the database, *whatever they are currently expired or not*.


## How to implement?
### As a linux service (Recommended)

Create your config file in the main directory and call `service.sh` as root. The service then will be started on bootup and will listen to connections.
### Binaries
1) Get binaries for your architecture and execute it in the background (check [releases](https://github.com/DorianCoding/OCSP-server/releases/tag/v0.4.0)).

*Feel free to share binaries for others architectures in a PR so they can be added. Please post only optimized binaries (release).*
### Compile from source
1) Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/DorianCoding/OCSP-server.git`
2) Type `cargo run` or `cargo run --release` and enjoy üëç
## MySql table
This script requires a table with this kind of structure :
```
CREATE TABLE `list_certs` (
  `cert_num` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `revocation_time` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
  `revocation_reason` enum('unspecified','key_compromise','ca_compromise','affiliation_changed','superseded','cessation_of_operation','certificate_hold','privilege_withdrawn','aa_compromise') DEFAULT NULL,
  `status` enum('Valid','Revoked') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Valid',
  PRIMARY KEY (`cert_num`),
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4
```
- The certificate number **must be unique** and start with 0x (like a hex number). Revocation_time must be in UTC timezone.
- When the certificate is valid, status must be "Valid" and revocation_time and reason must be NULL. On the opposite, upon revocation, status must be "Revoked" and revocation_time and reason must be set.
## Script test and timeline
### Test integration
You can test the script using `openssl` and replacing issuer and cert by files containing respectively the issuer and the local certificate :
```bash
openssl ocsp -issuer myissuer.crt -cert localcert.crt -url http://localhost:9000 -resp_text
```
You should get a valid OCSP response. If you don't, check integration.
### Timeline
The script is fast and can be used in production systems. Here is the time taken using a 2048-bit RSA key as signing key :

| Architecture | CPU | RAM | Time to perform [test](#Test) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| armv7l 32-bit | Raspberry<sup>TM</sup> | 1 Go | 0,4s from scratch and 0,12s from cache |
| x86_64 | Intel-i5 6<sup>th</sup> generation | 16 Go | 0,2s from scratch and 0,04s from cache |

### Input
This software requires an OCSP request in binary form from the socket client. A request look like this (**in base64 format**), the binary form (DER format) is not human-readable but is the one needed :
```
MHoweDBRME8wTTAJBgUrDgMCGgUABBRGf2x685RgF9qF4azpunF6LM75OQQUwX3C7a+au9Af8tx/
tcfCxFkwR68CFAlOMV+mrbm8PqIFZKeyLubrqlXgoiMwITAfBgkrBgEFBQcwAQIEEgQQkcDcDZCP
zGR57CNCnt6eKg==
```
You can use `openssl ocsp -reqin file -req_text` to verify the format, which will give you something like this :
```
OCSP Request Data:
    Version: 1 (0x0)
    Requestor List:
        Certificate ID:
          Hash Algorithm: sha1

            041091C0DC0D908FCC6479EC23429EDE9E2A
```
### Output
The software will give a binary file which is the OCSP response in DER format, just as before, the base64 form :
